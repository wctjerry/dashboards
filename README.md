# Dashboard Gallery

This repo lists a few data dashboards I've designed based on some public/fake data. A data dashboard is a great tool to visually (and always easily) track key metrics across the team and company, identify abnormal trends, and potentially give you some clues to drill down and find opportunities to improve. There are quite a few tools and platforms which we can use to build dashboards, from visualizing to automatically update the data on a regular basis. Below I will show some cases.

### Yammer Dashboard with Mode

Mode is an online BI tool that supports SQL, Python and R. In this demo, I will demonstrate how I use Mode to design a dashboard for Yammer. *(The data used is fake due to privacy protection, but the trends are similar.)*

> [Yammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yammer) (acquired by Microsoft in 2012) is a social network for communicating with coworkers. Individuals share documents, updates, and ideas by posting them in groups. As a social network platform, this dashboard will help Yammer easily understand its performance on user acquisition and retention. In this demo, I've also shown how a dashboard could help you easily identify abnormality (WAU is decreasing), and narrow down possible causes behind the scene (Something wrong with Email compaign).
